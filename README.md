# art_gallery
This is a Front End HTML_CSS project for an exhibition Art Gallery Website.  

#Description
This website showcases different art works exhibited. It has two main pages- 
- The Main Gallery Page:
  This page showcases various art works and provides a brief description of the office working hours for the arts center.
  This page also invites visitors, to pay a physical visit to the site, and has a link to the location page.

- The Location Page:
  This page has a map guide, as well as physical address providing directions to the arts exhibition center.
  At the bottom of this page is information on the social media links (facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts).

I encountered a few challenges whilst placing items on the page, exactly according to the required specifications,though these have been resolved. 
The website has been developed using HTML and CSS only as tools.
